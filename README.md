# New York Times Website Replica
This project is a replica of the New York Times website. The goal was to create a user interface similar to the original, utilizing modern technologies like React to build a responsive, dynamic, and interactive design. The site includes a sign-up page for user registration (design only) and leverages the New York Times APIs to fetch and display the latest news in real-time.

## Key Features:
- **Responsive Design**: The site adapts seamlessly to mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Interactive Interface**: Smooth user interactions and dynamic content loading.
- **Sign-up Page**: Users can register and access personalized features.
- **Real-time News**: Fetches the latest articles directly from the New York Times API.
